This repository is for the Digital Carb Sync Shield project. The shield is designed for the Arduino UNO R3
and other compatible boards.

The software is licensed under the MIT model.
The hardware is licensed using Open Hardware License.

The shield reads up to 6 vacuum pressure sensors on A0-5 and displays running peaks.

There is a calibration step to average the analog inputs. This is to compensate for build quality issues.
