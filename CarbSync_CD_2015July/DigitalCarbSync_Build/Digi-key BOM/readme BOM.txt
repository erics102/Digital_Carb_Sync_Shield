Shop around for better prices on the Arduino, the LCD and sensors.

The LCD is a standard item and much cheaper elsewhere. Just look for a 16x2 text backlit LCD.
80mm x 36mm outline is usual. About 12mm thick. 16pin connection. 0.1" (2.54mm) pitch.

The sensors are sometimes available at a lower price.

The rest of the parts are fairly cheap and fit the board

You can find compatible clones on Amazon and Ebay for the Arduino UNO R3.

These BOMs can be uploaded at digikey.com to create an order.
The order can be edited.
